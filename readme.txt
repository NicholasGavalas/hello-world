I've been feeling lonely
I need someone to hold me
Come on, baby, hold me
Yeah, I've been feeling jaded
Don't know how I should play it
Tell me how to play it
Now you, you've been moving on
Let me know, can I come along?
Since you're gone, oh, it's been so long
On my own, my own, my own, my own
Living in a haze, staying in the shade
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
I could use a break, can I get an Amen?
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
Uh, uh
Can I get an Amen?
Introverted, can't make friends
Pray for better days, now it's 300k when my day ends
Do you remember last night? 'Cause I blacked out
In that all white dress with her back out
Said, be careful with her heart 'cause it's fragile
And thinking 'bout her past make her lash out
See, with me it ain't no worries at all
Any problem I'll be there, one call
If we locked in, you my dawg
Fan of you, hang pictures on my wall
Roll one, let's get high tonight
Backseat, Maybach, lavish life
Chilling with the stars like a satellite
AP on my arm and it's shining bright
Living in a haze, staying in the shade
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
I could use a break, can I get an Amen?
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
Sit around, sit around, sit around and wait
For better, better, better days
Oh, I could use a break
Oh, better, better, better, better
For better days, oh no
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
Better days
All I do is sit around and wait for better days, no
Got a new nine that'll leave your mouth wide
Leave you hogtied, burnin' on a campfire
Before I leave the crib, I pray to God I won't die
I know it's hard to kill me, but I know they gon' try
You's a pussy boy, yeah, you a feline
Get your own business and get out of mine
Had to kill a witness, ain't doin' no time
Watch them friends around you, they playin' both sides
Boy, your gang ain't your gang and your homies not your homies
Run it up, get that sack, but do that shit right by your lonely
Chopper hit him with a force like I'm Obi-Wan Kenobi
Don't need no court to use my torch, I've been shootin' like I'm Kobe
I don't need nobody, I just need your body, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm gon' catch a body if you fuck with my money, ayy, ayy, ayy
Mixin' up narcotics, turned me to a zombie
Ape with a friend, Harambe, pull up on a friend, no talkin'
Leave a friend leakin', no faucet, yeah
Stand up to the opps, never back down
He'll get beat with the belt like it's Smackdown
Studio, juug life, trap house
Crack cocaine my track outs
Up late night like owls
Backwoods, smokin' no White Owls
I got the lean on me right now
Got a gun with a beam on me right now
Got a new nine that'll leave your mouth wide
Leave you hogtied, burnin' on a campfire
Before I leave the crib, I pray to God I won't die
I know it's hard to kill me, but I know they gon' try
You's a pussy boy, yeah, you a feline
Get your own business and get out of mine
Had to kill a witness, ain't doin' no time
Watch them friends around you, they playin' both sides
Get them friends from 'round you if they won't ride
Lot of opps', they love to talk, but they don't slide
Gang'nem on Evergreen and hustlin', bitch, we don't hide
Can't be with new friends, they bring around the wrong vibe
They put in years on that war, I'm with some real vets
Your boyfriend still on the porch, he ain't in the field yet
Them guns blatt, no hit and run, you get your grill rattled
You had it rough when you was young, so I can feel that
That pain put anger in your heart, you wanna kill 'em all
I lost my friend from the start, I hate I missed his call
If you stay loyal, play your part, then you gon' get to ball
Fast lane, we never go and park, I just keep driftin' off
Got a new nine that'll leave your mouth wide
Leave you hogtied, burnin' on a campfire
Before I leave the crib, I pray to god I won't die
I know it's hard to kill me, but I know they gon' try
You's a pussy boy, yeah, you a feline
Get your own business and get out of mine
Had to kill a witness, ain't doin' no time
Watch them friends around you, they playin' both sides (yeah, yeah)
In a dream world rollin' with your dream girl (woo, yeah)
Said she love you but she won't leave me, she a fiend girl
I don't want her body, want her head, guillotine girl (head)
Devil's always wearing Prada, wear some Celine, girl
Sorry bae, I ain't what you used to
I was raised up heartless, I'm a loose screw
I'ma get all up in your head and seduce you
Chillin' with some friends in the back that'll shoot at you, yeah
Ready, set, aim (boom), I'ma blow your damn brain
If I hop out the car and shoot the bitch at close range
We ain't playing both sides, chopper with me, .45
Juice gon' hold like two nines, bitch, we 1400, 999
Got a new nine that'll leave your mouth wide (wide)
Leave you hogtied, burnin' on a campfire (fire)
Before I leave the crib, I pray to God I won't die (die)
I know it's hard to kill me, but I know they gon' try (try)
You's a pussy boy, yeah, you a feline (feline)
Get your own business and get out of mine (mine)
Had to kill a witness, ain't doin' no time (time)
Watch them friends around you, they playin' both sides (sides)
